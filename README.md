Binary Classification: Logistic regression is used for binary classification tasks with two possible outcomes.It predicts one of two possible outcomes (e.g., Yes/No) and provides probabilities instead of direct class labels.
Sigmoid Function: It employs a sigmoid function to model the probability of the binary outcome, producing values between 0 and 1. Instead of class labels, it predicts the probability of belonging to a specific class. 
Use Case: Logistic regression is commonly used in various fields for tasks like disease prediction, customer churn, and credit risk assessment.
